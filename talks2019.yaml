    Hie, I'm Akshat, a Govt. of India recognized Silicon Valley fellow and a Harvard University Conference Scholar.
    Currently, I'm working on the problem of distracted driving and recently built an Android app
    (visit: inSessionApp.com) to manage my calls and acknowledging callers while I sleep. I've previously worked at
    a Thailand based and a California based company. This summers, I'm working with an India based startup as a Software
    Engineer. Above all this, I love to empower people in my connection.

    Python helped me fulfill my teenage dream to visit silicon valley before turning
    20. I won an intercollege hackathon for building a Vision app using python, which
    got selected me for silicon valley and eminent Harvard Conf. A senior from my
    college inspired me, now, I wish to inspire novices.

    I am always fascinated about programming languages. In particular, I have long advocated for the use of functional
    programming over object-oriented programming and a declarative style over an imperative one. Despite having used
    Python heavily since 2013, groking Scala, Haskell and Clojure really changed my style of writing Python code.
    I would like to share some of my findings and advocate a functional style of programming in Python. My other
    interests include Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods and high-performance computing.

    I am a co-founder and managing director of Arithmox, a startup offering CTO-as-a-service and growth hacking
    packages to Indonesian companies. My interest lies in the use of technology and data-driven approaches correctly
    to drive growth. In a business climate where it is easy to get sucked into the AI hype, I advocate a pragmatic
    and no-nonsense approach to introducing such technologies into already-running businesses.
  description: >-
    In this talk, I argue that Python is not quite a functional programming language.
    We draw examples from Haskell and Clojure to highlight the importance of immutability,
    functional core and reusable data. We look into writing idiomatic Python, whilst
    enjoying the benefits of functional programming.

    I am currently researching in the field of NLP and information retrieval as a project assistant at IIT Delhi. I am a recent graduate, and had been conferred with a degree of Bachelors in technology in Computer Science, in August 2018.
    I got introduced to the wonders of computer science while pursuing my undergraduate degree, and oh, boy! It was diverse. I was amazed with the profusion of avenues that it opened for me. From natural language chatbots, to  biometrics recognition systems, path-planning robots, I found it ever-so encouraging just to be in the game, and with a curious eye, was ready to unearth it all.
    I can program in multiple languages, Python, C/C++, R, Matlab, Chapel, GoLang, Java , Python being my first love since freshman days!.  Recently I have started programming in GoLang, and it happens to be new found love. I am interested in the fields of NLP, ML, AI, having studied them during my senior year, and I wish to work on  enhancing healthcare with AI. More specifically  I want to work towards making technology come to the the aid of unfortunately or differently abled people, so that they can lead healthy lives. I am inspired by the advancing developments in making computers imitate and understand human language, vision and intelligence and so much more, which I feel can be used to solve challenges that the differently abled people face.
    I am an avid reader, an eloquent writer, and love to share my experiences with others as well as learn from others. I do love to talk a lot too. A cup of hot chocolate, my laptop and a problem to code on, is what my daily routine sounds like.
  description: >
    "Ok Google, Tell me how do you work?" Have you ever wondered, what goes behind asking a voice assistant to perform

    Microservices are taking over the world. Rest-framework is accelerating this because
